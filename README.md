# Mon Vieux Grimoire - Backend

## Project Configuration

1. Clone the project from GitHub.

2. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project with environment-specific variables. Here's an example of the `.env` file content:


TOKEN_SECRET=the_token_here
MONGODB_URI=the_mongodb_uri_here
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development


3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.

4. Run `npm run dev` to start the server in development mode. The server should be running on `http://localhost:4000`.

**Note:** Make sure to keep the `.env` file confidential and avoid uploading it to GitHub.
